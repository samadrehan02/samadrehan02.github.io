      <p class="intro">
        I work on machine learning systems with a research mindset, focusing on
        reproducibility, controlled generation, and real-world failure modes.
        My interests include LLM behavior under constraints, structured outputs,
        and low-resource, mixed-language NLP. Most of my work is open source and
        designed to be inspected, reproduced, and extended.

          Production-grade dynamic pricing system for a general retail store,
          combining demand forecasting with constraint-based price optimization.

        <p class="project-focus">
          <strong>Engineering focus:</strong><br />
          Designing a real-world pricing system that optimizes revenue while
          respecting margin constraints, price stability, inventory risk,
          and operational safety.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Built a two-stage system with ML-based demand forecasting
            (XGBoost, walk-forward validation) and a deterministic pricing optimizer
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented hard business constraints including minimum margin,
            maximum daily price change, clearance deadlines, and stock-out avoidance
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed offline counterfactual simulation comparing static,
            rule-based, and ML-driven pricing strategies
          </li>
          <li>
            Added comprehensive evaluation with revenue trends, category-level
            breakdowns, and price-change stability analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Defined production monitoring, drift detection, and retraining
            playbooks for safe deployment

        </ul>

        <p class="project-focus">
          <strong>Outcomes:</strong><br />
          • Demonstrated stable, constraint-respecting ML pricing behavior<br />
          • Validated pricing safety via offline simulation and volatility analysis<br />
          • Produced reproducible evaluation artifacts and visualizations
