# samadrehan02.github.io

Personal portfolio and project landing page.

This site complements my resume by focusing on **system design decisions, applied ML tradeoffs, and how projects are structured**, rather than listing metrics or timelines.

## Why this site is simple

This site is intentionally built with:
- Plain **HTML**
- **CSS** for layout, theming, and motion
- A small amount of **vanilla JavaScript** for local interactions

No frameworks, no build step, no client-side routing.

The goal is:
- Fast load time
- Minimal maintenance
- Clear presentation of work
- Easy long-term ownership

## What this site emphasizes

- **Applied LLM / NLP systems**  
  (RAG pipelines, ASR + NLP workflows, structured generation)

- **Engineering judgment**  
  (ordering of components, safety constraints, real-world failure modes)

- **Production-minded thinking**  
  (real-time constraints, robustness, reproducibility)

This is not a design showcase or a scroll-driven marketing page.
